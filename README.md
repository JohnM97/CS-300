# CS-300
In the CS 300 projects, the main problem I worked on was creating software to help academic advisors at ABC University manage course information. The program needed to load course data from a file, store it in a data structure, and allow users to view all courses in order or look up specific course details, including prerequisites. Choosing the right data structure was a big part of the project, as it affected how quickly and efficiently the program could handle these tasks.

To solve the problem, I explored vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees, learning how each worked and their strengths and weaknesses. I ended up choosing hash tables because they are fast for searching and inserting data, which fit the program’s needs. Understanding data structures was really important because they shape how programs handle data, especially with larger datasets.

One challenge I faced was dealing with input files that had errors or missing data. To fix this, I added validation checks to ensure the file was correctly formatted before loading it into the program. Debugging was also tricky, especially with hash tables and memory issues. I tested the program a lot and used small, clear functions to make debugging easier.

This project taught me how to plan my code better by writing pseudocode first and breaking the program into smaller tasks. I’ve also learned to write code that’s easier to read and maintain by using clear names, comments, and modular functions. These skills will help me write better, more reliable programs in the future.
